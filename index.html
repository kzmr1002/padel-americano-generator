            <p>
                Mexicano is an exciting and fast-paced variation of the traditional Padel tournament format. In Mexicano, participants also switch partners and opponents in each round - but with one twist: matchups are based on current standings. This makes the tournament more dynamic and competitive, as better-performing players get paired with lower-ranked players to keep matches balanced and exciting!
            </p>
            <p>
                Each match is played to a predefined number of points, such as 24 or 32. After the match, every player gets the number of points they and their partner won. For example, if a match ends 18-6, the two players on the winning side each get 18 points, while the two on the losing side get 6.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes Mexicano unique is that matchups change based on rankings after each round. Higher-ranked players are automatically paired with lower-ranked ones, ensuring that each round stays fair, varied, and engaging for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                We recommend playing with a number of players divisible by 4 (e.g. 4, 8, 12, 16…) for optimal rotation. Each match should have a balanced length (e.g. 24 or 32 points), and the whole tournament usually lasts 1.5-2 hours, depending on the number of participants.
            </p>
            <p>
                With our Mexicano app, you don't need to worry about scheduling matches or calculating scores manually. Just enter the results, and the app will handle everything - from updating the leaderboard to generating the next round's pairings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mexicano is a perfect mix of strategy, fun, and fairness. Try it out and enjoy the ride — may the best player win!
